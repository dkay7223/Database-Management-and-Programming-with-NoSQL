## 2.0 Scenario

Goodreads, a subsidiary of Amazon, is a prominent American social cataloging website. It serves as a platform where users can explore a vast database of books, annotations, quotes, and reviews. Users have the ability to create library catalogues, reading lists, and engage in various activities such as forming book groups, suggesting books, conducting surveys, polls, blogs, and participating in discussions. The content in this section is directly sourced from the Wikipedia page.

- Goodreads provides a dedicated web page for each book (e.g., [Book Page](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5333265)).
- Similarly, each review has its own web page (e.g., [Review Page](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2410025795)).

For this coursework, a specific subset of data from Goodreads has been selected. This dataset includes information on books, reviews, authors, and genres. The use of this data has been granted permission from [UCSD Book Graph](https://sites.google.com/eng.ucsd.edu/ucsdbookgraph/home), with the condition that the authors' research papers are appropriately referenced ([Mengting W. and Julian J. M 2018](#)), ([Mengting W et al. 2019](#)). Reading these papers is not mandatory for completing the coursework.
